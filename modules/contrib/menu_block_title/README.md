## Menu block title

This module adds an option to menu_block and system menu blocks which when active will show the menu parent as the block's title. This makes for useful sidebar menus where the block title is a link     back to the menu parent.

### How to use

Once installed, place a system provided menu block or create and place a menu_block module provided menu block. This module works best with a block starting at menu level 2.

When editing the configuration for that block in the UI you should notice a checkbox at the bottom of the page with the following label: "Block title as menu link parent"

Check this option and make sure the block title is not hidden and save the block. When you visit the page with this block placed on it you should see the title of the block is now the parent item of    the menu.
