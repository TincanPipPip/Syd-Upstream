# A "migration group" is - surprise! - a group of migrations. It is used to
# group migrations for display by our tools, and to perform operations on a
# specific set of migrations. It can also be used to hold any configuration
# common to those migrations, so it doesn't have to be duplicated in each one.

# The machine name of the group, by which it is referenced in individual
# migrations.
id: spektrix

# A human-friendly label for the group.
label: Spektrix Importers

# More information about the group.

# As with the migration configuration (see beer_term), we add an enforced
# dependency so the migration_group configuration will be removed on module
# uninstall.
